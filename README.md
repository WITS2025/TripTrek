## 🛠️ **Development Stack**
This project uses React with Vite for a fast and modern frontend development experience, and Node.js for backend logic. It leverages AWS Lambda (via AWS SAM), Amazon DynamoDB and API Gateway to support a fully serverless architecture.

## 📥 **Installation**

#### To run the app locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WITS2025/TripTrek.git
   cd TripTrek
   ```

### 2. Setup frontend
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
#### Steps 3 and 4 are optional

### 3. Setup backend
   
   Ensure you have AWS CLI and AWS SAM CLI installed.
   ```bash
   cd ../backend
   npm run install-all
   sam build
   sam deploy
   ```
### 4. Connect frontend to backend
   
   Update frontend/context/TripContext.jsx line 17 and frontend/context/TripContext.test.jsx line 6
   
   Set the API base URL to the deployed API Gateway URL from the SAM deploy output. Make sure to include the trailing slash.
   ```bash
   const API_Endpoint =  'https://your-api-endpoint.amazonaws.com/'
   ```

### Google Maps setup

The itinerary uses the Google Maps JavaScript API and its client-side geocoder.

1. In Google Cloud, use a project with billing enabled and enable:
   - Maps JavaScript API
   - Geocoding API
   - Places API (New)
   - Weather API
2. Create a browser API key and restrict it to websites (HTTP referrers):
   - `http://localhost:5173/*`
   - `https://trekatrip.com/*`
   - `https://www.trekatrip.com/*`
   - The Amplify domain, if it is used directly
3. Restrict the browser key to Maps JavaScript API, Geocoding API, and Places API (New).
4. For local development, create `frontend/.env.local`:
   ```env
   VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_browser_key
   ```
5. For production, add `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` in the Amplify app's environment variables and redeploy the frontend.

6. Create a second server API key for Weather API only. Do not put it in Amplify or a `VITE_` variable. Store it in AWS Secrets Manager in `us-east-1` as `TrekATrip/google-maps-server`, then deploy the SAM backend. The weather Lambda is the only component permitted to read it.

Browser map keys are included in the built JavaScript and are inspectable. Never use an unrestricted key; the website and API restrictions are what protect it.

### AI Travel Assistant setup

Trekka calls OpenAI through the authenticated backend Lambda. Store the OpenAI key in AWS Secrets Manager as `TrekATrip/openai`; never add an OpenAI key to a `VITE_` variable or frontend file.
